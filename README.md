# Laserpecker L1 & L1 Pro Review
I am a happy owner of both LaserPecker L1 and L1 Pro. Here I share some of my thoughts and uses of them. I'll refer to L1 Pro as Pro for short in the rest of the artical.


# LaserPecker
LaserPecker is brand of affordable and portable cunsumer level laser engravers. So far they have released their first generation laser engraveers (a standard and a Pro version). The company will release more models with more powerful capabilities in 2020 and future.

For more details, visit their official [English site](https://www.laserpecker.net/) or [Chinese site](http://www.laserpecker.cn/).
