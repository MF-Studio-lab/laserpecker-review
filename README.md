# LaserPecker L1 & L1 Pro Review
I am a happy owner of both LaserPecker L1 and L1 Pro. Here I share some of my thoughts and uses of them. I may refer to L1 Pro as Pro for short in the rest of the article.


# LaserPecker
LaserPecker is brand of affordable and portable consumer level laser engravers. So far they have released their first generation laser engravers (L1 and L1 Pro). The company will release more models with more powerful capabilities in 2020 and the near future.

For more details, visit their official [English site](https://www.laserpecker.net/) or [Chinese site](http://www.laserpecker.cn/).


# L1 vs L1 Pro

## The Look
L1 and Pro are of the same size & design, with minor difference as shown below. Therefore both will fit onto the automatic stand.

## Key Specifications

|  | L1 | L1 Pro |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Laser | 450nm Blue, 1600mW | 405nm Blue-Violet, 500mW (equivalent to 1500mW Blue laser) |
| Pixel Size | 0.3mm (or smaller\*)| 0.15mm |
| Engrave Range|100mm x 100mm (or larger\**)| 100mm x 100mm (106mm x 106mm\*\*\*)|


\* Can be improved with an easy modification, but engraving range will reduce as a trade-off. Read on.

\*\* With Gcode. Read on.

\*\*\* With Gcode, but the improvement is so small that it's not worth the trouble.
