# LaserPecker L1 & L1 Pro Review
I am a happy owner of both LaserPecker L1 and L1 Pro. Here I share some of my thoughts and uses of them. I'll refer to L1 Pro as Pro for short in the rest of the artical.


# LaserPecker
LaserPecker is brand of affordable and portable cunsumer level laser engravers. So far they have released their first generation laser engraveers (L1 and L1 Pro). The company will release more models with more powerful capabilities in 2020 and the near future.

\* Can be improved with an easy modification, but engraving range will reduce as a trade-off. Read on.

\*\*\* With Gcode, but the improvement is so small that it's not worth the trouble.
