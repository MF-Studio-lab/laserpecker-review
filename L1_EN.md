# All About L1

L1 is cheaper, faster, slightly more powerful than the Pro. Accuracy-wise, it's not as precise as Pro. You need to think about what you want to achieve. As an owner of L1 Pro, I'd say it does not replace L1 completely, and I will keep using my L1 for certain tasks.

## Engraving Beyond the Designed Range
Trust me, you will love my finding!

**This trick only applies to engraving with Gcode files.**

After testing my L1 with some hand crafted Gcode, I discovered that despite the limitation of 100mm x 100mm engraving range, you can actually leverage L1's hidden X/Y axis movement capability, to engrave over as large as **200mm x 140mm** range. It's all about absolute and relative Gcode coordinates.

In short, per engraving job still has to follow the *no larger than 100mm x 100mm* rule, but each job can be placed anywhere within the 200mm x 140mm range. So, you can divide your larger vector graphics into a few small parts to be engraved one by one. I'll update my [Inkscape extension](https://github.com/yy502/inkscape-laserpecker) to simplify the generation of Gcode files for LaserPecker.

Here's a peak of the result. This was done with L1 at 20cm distance, without moving the engraver or the paper.

## Kick-Ass Modification (Cheap & Cheerful) 

Hint: increases cutting power, improves resolution to (almost) match Pro's
