## Instructions

I created these Gcode files using the templates downloaded from above linked web sites, and take no credit for the design. 

**These Gcode files are tailored for LaserPecker L1 and L1 Pro ONLY**

Steps:
1. Download all 3 Gcode (`.txt`) files listed above to your phone.
    * Android: copy to `(phone storage) > laserpecker files` directory in your phone. This is also where additional custom fonts (`.ttf` files) live.
    * iOS (2nd-hand info): copy to `Files > Laserpecker > matarialgcode directory` (yes, the directory name is misspelt by LP).
2. .....
4. If 1-pass didn't cut it perfectly, do not move it and have a 2nd pass. And for the following cuts, use the multi pass setting for the number of passes your paper requires.
5. To avoid paper warping and ruining the job, use some weights around the paper to keep it down.
